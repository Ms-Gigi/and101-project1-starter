# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

## Summary

**Hello Squirrel** is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø.  

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üëãüèæüêøÔ∏èüí¨**

## Notes

- I spent a lot of time trying to implement a custom profile image. I converted it to both PNG and JPG formats, placed it in the correct `res/drawable` folder, and updated the `ImageView` in `activity_main.xml`.
- The image **successfully showed in the Android Studio preview**, but it did **not appear at runtime** on the emulator. I tried renaming the file, switching image types, cleaning and rebuilding the project, and even wiping the emulator ‚Äî but the issue persisted.
- Although I wasn‚Äôt able to get the image working in the final app, the process helped me understand how Android handles drawables, emulator behavior, and layout previews vs runtime rendering.
- I really enjoyed customizing the UI with a pastel theme and adding personality through the emojis and hobby section
